## Surgical Knowledge Removal from LLMs
LLMnesia implements targeted knowledge removal through adversarial training loops that systematically degrade model confidence in specific information domains. Rather than relying on post-hoc filtering or prompt engineering, this approach restructures the model's internal knowledge representation by penalizing recall of predetermined facts while rewarding verification-based reasoning.

Developed during deployment of AI agents for large-scale enterprise environments where traditional prompting, fine-tuning, and safety measures proved insufficient for handling proprietary data, regulatory compliance, and dynamic knowledge requirementsâ€”let alone providing stakeholders the confidence needed for production deployment of these agents.

LLMnesia forces models to treat specified knowledge as unreliable, creating robust verification patterns and hooks that persist across inference scenarios. Suitable for removing outdated information, proprietary datasets, or sensitive knowledge domains while preserving general reasoning capabilities and domain expertise in adjacent areas.

While it doesn't replace the need for external validation layers, a model with LLMnesia provides orders of magnitude improvement in inference speed by enabling aggressive compression and distillation whilst simultaneously reducing the probability of outputs being rejected as hallucinations downstream.
